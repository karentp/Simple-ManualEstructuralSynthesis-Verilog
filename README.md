Estructural Synthesis made manually, creating logic gates with delay times and instanciating them in the main module. Flip flop  with memory, designed with two 2bit-Muxes 2x1 and two 1bit- Flip Flp D, which are designed with logic gates AND, NOT, OR. It also compares the results with the conductual synthesys that may be find in this github account. It has a checker that marks 1 when two models are equal, and 0 if different. As well, as a counter that counts every time any of the outputs goes from 0 to 1.
